LogKit 1.1.0 is a forward-compatibility release. Many of the framework's objects have been renamed to match their LogKit 2 counterparts. Aliases have been added to ensure that old names continue to work as expected. Existing software using LogKit 1.0.x can upgrade to 1.1.0 without requiring any changes. However, it is recommended that both new and existing software adopt the new LogKit 2 names, as it will ease upgrading to LogKit 2. A full list of changed names can be found in the release notes.
