LogKit is a logging framework built to be **simple** to get started with, **efficient** to execute, **safe** for shipping code, and **extensible** for flexibility. It is written in pure Swift and is suitable for OS X, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS application logging. For a developer looking for more power than `print()`, LogKit takes just a moment to get started with, and comes ready to log to the console, a file, an HTTP service, or all three. Need to log to somewhere else? Defining your own [Endpoint][endpoints] is easy too.
