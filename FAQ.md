> Aren't there enough logging frameworks out there? (Or, what's so special about LogKit?)

Perhaps, but when did that stop anyone? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

LogKit provides something we haven't yet seen elsewhere in Swift-based iOS/Mac logging frameworks. It's compact, extensible, includes a few nice batteries, and is documented. It's production-safe, efficient, and strives to be quick.
